## Live demo
Our latest build is live at https://opensuse.github.io/openSUSE-docs-revamped/.

## /!\ Disclaimer
This is the construction site for the upcoming Leap and Tumbleweed documentation. Please do not consider any of this as official documentation *for now*. Use instead:
- Generic documentation based on Leap: https://doc.opensuse.org/
- Tumbleweed specific knowledge-base: https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed

## About
Take a look at the "About" section (right panel). You can also check [this](https://news.opensuse.org/2020/10/12/join-our-team-and-help-us-imporove-the-openSUSE-learning-experience/) out for context. If you wonder why we are doing this when there is already an official documentation along with wikis, the answer is two-fold:
* wikis make it difficult to sort the outdated / unofficial stuff from the up-to-date / official stuff
* the official docs is slightly outdated, provides too little recommendations or best-practice advices on top of technical facts, is tedious to navigate at times and does not cater for Tumbleweed users.

We are therefore working with people from the official docs to move to a maintainer-centric model, which we believe will better serve the openSUSE community.
